# ConsoleSnakeGame-Python
A snake game written in Python from scratch.

## How to play
Download the .py files and place them in a folder.

Install `Python 3.6.2`

> If you are using a diffent console than the windows command prompt, edit the "ASCIICanvas.py" file and change the `CLAERCONSOLECOMMAND` variable to a value that will clear your console's window.

Run the `start.py` file in your console using python.

Eg: In windows command prompt run `py <path to start.py>`, or you may also be able to directly run `start.py` by double-clcking it if Python was installed correctly.
